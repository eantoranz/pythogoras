Lilypy is a lousy lilypond parser I created in order to parse simple lilypond scripts.

The need for this parser came from my working on a special personal research I'm doing on
tuning systems.

Don't expect to get this to work for every single lilypond script out there as I only got to develop it
to parse veeeeeeeeeery simple scripts. You have been warned.

In any case, hope it fullfils your needs.

Last but not least, lilypy is free software released under the terms of the Affero GPLv3.
